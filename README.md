## Features

- Central application management: Application support center acts as a central management portal for all of your applications. Store a list of application owners, developers, source code links, and application details in one place.
- In-app Help: Application support center provides a Mobile SDK, UI5 SDK, Web SDK, Web Portal and API's sharing help, release notes, and details about each application for your end-users. This provides the opportunity for self-service before they contact support.
