Thank you for your interest in contributing to application support center.

There are many ways in which you can contribute beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

Have a question? Please create an issue and tag it appropriately. Your well-worded question will serve as a resource to others searching for help.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [paul.aschmann@sap.com](mailto:paul.aschmann@sap.com).

## Report Issues

To report a bug or make a feature suggestion, please use the Issues section of this repository. Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.


### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please search in [open issues](https://https://github.com/SAP/application-support-center/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has been created already. We have listed some "big ideas" in the [projects section](https://github.com/SAP/application-support-center/projects) of GitHub.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Please do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Your operating system

* Browser and version

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring

* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

## Contribute Code

We welcome external contributions. Please fork the code and submit a pull request. Please note: for legal reasons, and we request that contributors accept a DCO - Please see below.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before submitting the first pull request to this project. This happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
